### Data Science
* * *
List of Data Science, AI, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, NLP projects that I tackled using Python/R/MATLAB. 

  1. **[Kaggle] Recruit Restaurant Forecasting Vistor (Python):**  [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Useful-Python-Scripts/tree/master/Kaggle/Recruit%20Restaurant%20Visitor%20Forecasting) I was given 3-5 days to work on this case study and the goal is to predict the number of visitors of each restaurants in Japan for future dates. The link contains data analysis and prediction scripts written in Python.

  2. **[Kaggle] BigQuery Geotab Intersection Congestion (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Useful-Python-Scripts/tree/master/Kaggle/BigQuery%20Geotab%20Intersection%20Congestion) The main objective is to predict wait times at four major city intersections in USA. I explored the data sets using Python and the script can be found in the given link.
  
  3. **Urban Sound Recognition (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Useful-Python-Scripts/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/Urban%20Sound%20Recognition) The main objective is to identify the sound events from the urban area using Convolutional Netural Networks (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Scripts include real time sound recognition using computer microphone and CNN model to predict the category.
  
  4. **Email Sentiment Analysis (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Useful-Python-Scripts/tree/master/NLP/Email%20Sentiment%20Analysis) I use VADER and Spacy to perform basic Natural Language Processing Sentiment Analysis on my work emails to understand if the message I received or the sender are generally positive, negative or neutral.
  
  5. **Real Time Object Recognition using Tensorflow (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Useful-Python-Scripts/blob/master/Deep%20Learning/Real%20Time%20Object%20Recognition) A real time object recognition through computer webcam using Tensorflow and a pre-trained model. This folder also includes a script that counts and records number of people in real time event, and the idea is to produce a real time human detection and counting system through webcam.

  6. **Automated CCTV Sewer Pipe Defect Detection using Tensorflow (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Useful-Python-Scripts/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/Sewer%20Pipe%20Object%20Recognition) A pilot project with City West Water to develop an object recognition model to automatically review sewer pipe CCTV video files and identify three defect types (cracks, tree roots and voids). This folder does not include the model but shows the outcome of the model.
  

### Data Visualisation
* * *
A list of Visualisation dashboards that I created using Power BI or Tableau. 

  1. **Interactive Resume (Power BI):**  [[LINK]](https://bit.ly/yeevienresume2) My Interactive Resume.



### Optimisation and Simulation
* * *
Optimisation and Simulation projects built mainly in LINGO (an Optimisation modelling software), MATLAB Simulink and Excel.

  1. **[Paper] Optimised Scheduling of Water Supply Schemes (LINGO):** [[LINK]](https://www.mssanz.org.au/modsim2013/L4/ng.pdf) I helped developed an optimisation model and co-wrote a paper for the MODSIM 2013 conference. The aim is to automate planning around future known events to produce a least cost operational schedule of the water supply scheme and this paper describes the many factors that influence the scheme’s supply and demand sides, the “rules” engine for the operation of the components, the development of the Mathematical Programming Model (MABAL) and the presentation of simulation outcomes.
  
  2. **[Paper] Routing Field Service Officers with SIMULINK:** [[LINK]](https://www.mssanz.org.au/modsim2015/J4/ng.pdf) A water/sewerage asset failure require an immediate response by Field Service Office (FSO). I developed a simulation model using SIMULINK to simulate the current FSO job assignment process and test some alternative approaches to job prioritisation. I co-wrote this paper for MODSIM 2015 conference which describes the approach used to develop risk based job priority zones and the SIMULINK model.
  
  3. **Optimise Depot Location (LINGO):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/LINGO-Optimization/tree/master/Depot%20Location) This is a simple optimisation project with data being generated randomly. The main objective is to identify the optimal depot location for a water utility to service the maintenance jobs and minimise travel times.
