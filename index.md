  4. **Email Sentiment Analysis (NLP, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/Email%20Sentiment%20Analysis) A notebook which uses VADER and Spacy to perform basic NLP Sentiment Analysis on outlook emails to understand if the message I received or the sender are generally positive, negative or neutral.

  5. **Food Review Sentiment Analysis Comparison (NLP, DL, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/Food%20Review%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Comparison) A notebook that utilises both VADER (ML) and RoBERTa (DL) for conducting Sentiment Analysis on Amazon food review, aiming to forecast whether the reviews fall into the Negative, Neutral or Positive categories. The primary objective is to asess and compare the speed and accuracy of both techniques.
  
  6. **Real Time Object Recognition using Tensorflow (DL, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Real%20Time%20Object%20Recognition) A real time object recognition through computer webcam using Tensorflow and a pre-trained model.

  7. **Automated CCTV Sewer Pipe Defect Detection using Tensorflow (DL, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Sewer%20Pipe%20Object%20Recognition) A pilot project with City West Water to develop an object recognition model to automatically review sewer pipe CCTV video files and identify three defect types (cracks, tree roots and voids). This folder does not include the model, but it will display the outcome of the model.


  8. **Intent Based Resume Chatbot (NLP, DL, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/Resume%20Chatbot) A simple NLP and Neural Network intent based resume chatbot. The model predicts the user's intent based on the input and produces the best response from the given tag.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
* * *
Scripts for data analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset.

1. **BigQuery Geotab Intersection Congestion (DS, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/tree/main/BigQuery%20Geotab%20Intersection%20Congestion) A kaggle project. The notebook analyses the traffic patterns and congestions at the four major cities in USA. The ultimate goal is to predict wait times at the big cities' intersections, which is not included in this folder.

### Data Visualisation
* * *
Interactive dashboards and/or report that I developed 

  1. **Interactive Resume (PBI):**  [[LINK]](https://bit.ly/yeevienresume2) My Interactive Resume.

### Optimisation and Simulation
* * *
Optimisation and Simulation projects built mainly in LINGO (an Optimisation modelling software), MATLAB, Simulink and Excel.

*(Opt = Optimisation, Sim = Simulation)*

  1. **[Paper] Optimised Scheduling of Water Supply Schemes (Opt, LINGO):** [[LINK]](https://www.mssanz.org.au/modsim2013/L4/ng.pdf) I co-wrote a paper for the MODSIM 2013 conference. The aim is to automate planning around future known events to produce a least cost operational schedule of the water supply scheme and this paper describes the development of our MABAL optimisation model, the many factors that influence the scheme’s supply and demand sides, the “rules” engine for the operation of the components and the outcome of simulation.
  
  2. **[Paper] Routing Field Service Officers (Sim, SIMULINK):** [[LINK]](https://www.mssanz.org.au/modsim2015/J4/ng.pdf) I co-wrote this paper for the MODSIM 2015 conference. The aim of the project is to develop a simulation model to simulate the current Field Service Officer's (FSO) job assignment process and test some alternative approaches to job prioritisation to help improve the work response rate by the FSOs. This paper describes the approach used to develop risk based job priority zones and how the SIMULINK model is built.
  
  3. **Optimise Depot Location (Opt, LINGO):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Optimisation/tree/master/Depot%20Location) A simple optimisation project with data being generated randomly. The main objective is to identify the optimal depot location for a water utility to service the maintenance jobs and minimise travel times.

3. **Capture screenshots from the video with OpenCV (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Scripts/blob/master/Snippets/Capture%20image%20(screenshot)%20from%20video.ipynb) Using OpenCV to capture images per frame from the video and save it as .png. This is used to extract data images for image labelling in the image recognition projects.
4. **Auto sort images to Train/Test folder (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Scripts/blob/master/Snippets/Move%20Images%20with%20xml%20to%20Train%20and%20Test%20folder.ipynb) The aftermath of data labelling for the image recognition. This code will sort labelled images into train and test folder based on the nominated ratio, eg 80:20.
