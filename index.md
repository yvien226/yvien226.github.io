### Data Science
* * *
Data Science related projects using Python/R/MATLAB. 

*(ML = Machine Learning, DL = Deep Learning, NLP = Natural Language Processing, RL = Reinforcement Learning)*

  1. **[Kaggle] Recruit Restaurant Forecasting Vistor (ML, Python):**  [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Useful-Python-Scripts/tree/master/Kaggle/Recruit%20Restaurant%20Visitor%20Forecasting) I was given 3-5 days to work on this case study and the goal is to predict the number of visitors of each restaurants in Japan for future dates. The link contains data analysis and prediction scripts written in Python.

  2. **[Kaggle] BigQuery Geotab Intersection Congestion (ML, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Projects/tree/master/Kaggle/BigQuery%20Geotab%20Intersection%20Congestion) The main objective is to predict wait times at four major city intersections in USA. I explored the data sets using Python and the script can be found in the given link.
  
  3. **Urban Sound Recognition (DL, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Projects/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/Urban%20Sound%20Recognition) The main objective is to identify the sound events from the urban area using Convolutional Netural Networks (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Scripts include real time sound recognition using computer microphone and CNN model to predict the category.
  
  4. **Email Sentiment Analysis (NLP, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Projects/tree/master/NLP/Email%20Sentiment%20Analysis) I use VADER and Spacy to perform basic Natural Language Processing Sentiment Analysis on my work emails to understand if the message I received or the sender are generally positive, negative or neutral.

  5. **Money bot (NLP, Java):** [[LINK]]()  A bot that converts currency and provides currency rates. To be populated
  
  6. **Real Time Object Recognition using Tensorflow (DL, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Projects/blob/master/Deep%20Learning/Real%20Time%20Object%20Recognition) A real time object recognition through computer webcam using Tensorflow and a pre-trained model. This folder also includes a script that counts and records number of people in real time event, and the idea is to produce a real time human detection and counting system through webcam.

  7. **Automated CCTV Sewer Pipe Defect Detection using Tensorflow (DL, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Projects/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/Sewer%20Pipe%20Object%20Recognition) A pilot project with City West Water to develop an object recognition model to automatically review sewer pipe CCTV video files and identify three defect types (cracks, tree roots and voids). This folder does not include the model, but it will display the outcome of the model.

  8. **Intent Based Resume Chatbot (NLP, DL, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Projects/blob/master/NLP/Resume%20Chatbot/) A simple intent based resume chatbot, using NLTK's NLP to interpret human languages, then applied Tensorflow's Neural Network to predict the user's intent based on the input and produced the best response from the given tag. 


### Data Mining and Wrangling
* * *
Scripts/Queries and code snippets for data extraction, cleaning and processing.

1. **Auto download Outlook attachments (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Projects/blob/master/Snippets/Auto_Download_Outlook_Attachments.ipynb) The script downloads csv attachments from MS Outlook and save into local computer.
2. **Capture screenshots from the video with OpenCV (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Projects/blob/master/Snippets/Capture%20image%20(screenshot)%20from%20video.ipynb) Using OpenCV to capture images per frame from the video and save it as .png. This is used to extract data images for image labelling in the image recognition projects.
3. **Auto sort images to Train/Test folder (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Projects/blob/master/Snippets/Move%20Images%20with%20xml%20to%20Train%20and%20Test%20folder.ipynb) The aftermath of data labelling for the image recognition. This code will sort labelled images into train and test folder based on the nominated ratio.
4. **Webscraping Lotto data (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Projects/blob/master/Webs%20Scraping/webscraping_lotto.ipynb) A web scraping notebook to extract Tattslotto and Powerball data from lottolyzer website.
  

### Data Visualisation
* * *
Interactive dashboards and/or reports that I created using Power BI or Tableau. 

  1. **Interactive Resume (Power BI):**  [[LINK]](https://bit.ly/yeevienresume2) My Interactive Resume.



### Optimisation and Simulation
* * *
Optimisation and Simulation projects built mainly in LINGO (an Optimisation modelling software), MATLAB, Simulink and Excel.

*(LP = Linear Programming/Optimisation, Sim = Simulation)*

  1. **[Paper] Optimised Scheduling of Water Supply Schemes (Opt, LINGO):** [[LINK]](https://www.mssanz.org.au/modsim2013/L4/ng.pdf) I co-wrote a paper in the MODSIM 2013 conference. The aim is to automate planning around future known events to produce a least cost operational schedule of the water supply scheme and this paper describes the development of our MABAL optimisation model, the many factors that influence the scheme’s supply and demand sides, the “rules” engine for the operation of the components and the outcome of simulation.
  
  2. **[Paper] Routing Field Service Officers (Sim, SIMULINK):** [[LINK]](https://www.mssanz.org.au/modsim2015/J4/ng.pdf) I co-wrote this paper in the MODSIM 2015 conference. The aim of the project is to develop a simulation model to simulate the current Field Service Officer's (FSO) job assignment process and test some alternative approaches to job prioritisation to help improve the work response rate by the FSOs. This paper describes the approach used to develop risk based job priority zones and how the SIMULINK model is built.
  
  3. **Optimise Depot Location (Opt, LINGO):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Optimisation-Projects/tree/master/Depot%20Location) A simple optimisation project with data being generated randomly. The main objective is to identify the optimal depot location for a water utility to service the maintenance jobs and minimise travel times.
