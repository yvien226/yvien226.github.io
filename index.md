### Data Science
* * *
Data Science, AI and Machine Learning related projects 

*(DS = Data Science, ML = Machine Learning, DL = Deep Learning, NLP = Natural Language Processing, RL = Reinforcement Learning)*


  1. **Recruit Restaurant Forecasting Vistor (ML, Python):**  [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Recruit%20Restaurant%20Visitor%20Forecasting) A kaggle project to predict the number of visitors of each restaurants in Japan for future dates.

  2. **BigQuery Geotab Intersection Congestion (DS, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/tree/main/BigQuery%20Geotab%20Intersection%20Congestion) A kaggle project. The notebook analyses the traffic patterns and congestions at the four major cities in USA. The ultimate goal is to predict wait times at the big cities' intersections, which is not included in this folder.
  
  3. **Urban Sound Recognition (DL, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Urban%20Sound%20Recognition) A real time sound recognition using computer microphone and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict the category. The main objective is to identify the sound events from the urban area. 
  
  4. **Email Sentiment Analysis (NLP, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/Email%20Sentiment%20Analysis) A notebook which uses VADER and Spacy to perform basic NLP Sentiment Analysis on outlook emails to understand if the message I received or the sender are generally positive, negative or neutral.

  5. **Money bot (NLP, Javascript):** [[LINK]]()  A bot that converts currency and provides currency rates. To be populated
  
  6. **Real Time Object Recognition using Tensorflow (DL, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Real%20Time%20Object%20Recognition) A real time object recognition through computer webcam using Tensorflow and a pre-trained model. This folder also includes a script that counts and records number of people in real time event.

  7. **Automated CCTV Sewer Pipe Defect Detection using Tensorflow (DL, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Sewer%20Pipe%20Object%20Recognition) A pilot project with City West Water to develop an object recognition model to automatically review sewer pipe CCTV video files and identify three defect types (cracks, tree roots and voids). This folder does not include the model, but it will display the outcome of the model.

  8. **Webscraping Lotto data (DS, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Scripts/blob/master/Webs%20Scraping/webscraping_lotto.ipynb) A web scraping notebook to extract Tattslotto and Powerball data from lottolyzer website.

  8. **Intent Based Resume Chatbot (NLP, DL, Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/Resume%20Chatbot) A simple NLP and Neural Network intent based resume chatbot. The model predicts the user's intent based on the input and produces the best response from the given tag. 

  

### Data Visualisation
* * *
Interactive dashboards and/or report that I developed 

  1. **Interactive Resume (Power BI):**  [[LINK]](https://bit.ly/yeevienresume2) My Interactive Resume.



### Optimisation and Simulation
* * *
Optimisation and Simulation projects built mainly in LINGO (an Optimisation modelling software), MATLAB, Simulink and Excel.

*(Opt = Optimisation, Sim = Simulation)*

  1. **[Paper] Optimised Scheduling of Water Supply Schemes (Opt, LINGO):** [[LINK]](https://www.mssanz.org.au/modsim2013/L4/ng.pdf) I co-wrote a paper fpr the MODSIM 2013 conference. The aim is to automate planning around future known events to produce a least cost operational schedule of the water supply scheme and this paper describes the development of our MABAL optimisation model, the many factors that influence the scheme’s supply and demand sides, the “rules” engine for the operation of the components and the outcome of simulation.
  
  2. **[Paper] Routing Field Service Officers (Sim, SIMULINK):** [[LINK]](https://www.mssanz.org.au/modsim2015/J4/ng.pdf) I co-wrote this paper for the MODSIM 2015 conference. The aim of the project is to develop a simulation model to simulate the current Field Service Officer's (FSO) job assignment process and test some alternative approaches to job prioritisation to help improve the work response rate by the FSOs. This paper describes the approach used to develop risk based job priority zones and how the SIMULINK model is built.
  
  3. **Optimise Depot Location (Opt, LINGO):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Optimisation-Projects/tree/master/Depot%20Location) A simple optimisation project with data being generated randomly. The main objective is to identify the optimal depot location for a water utility to service the maintenance jobs and minimise travel times.


### Code Snippets
* * *
Useful code snippets for the projects 

1. **Template for training Machine Learning model (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Scripts/blob/master/Snippets/Useful%20Python%20codes%20for%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb) This notebook shows the template to train, test and evaluate all machine learning techniques.
2. **Auto download Outlook attachments (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Scripts/blob/master/Snippets/Auto_Download_Outlook_Attachments.ipynb) The script downloads csv attachments from MS Outlook and save into local computer.
3. **Capture screenshots from the video with OpenCV (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Scripts/blob/master/Snippets/Capture%20image%20(screenshot)%20from%20video.ipynb) Using OpenCV to capture images per frame from the video and save it as .png. This is used to extract data images for image labelling in the image recognition projects.
4. **Auto sort images to Train/Test folder (Python):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Python-Scripts/blob/master/Snippets/Move%20Images%20with%20xml%20to%20Train%20and%20Test%20folder.ipynb) The aftermath of data labelling for the image recognition. This code will sort labelled images into train and test folder based on the nominated ratio.
5. **Pivot transform MS Access data (SQL):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/SQL-Queries/blob/master/Snippets/Access_data_pivot_transform.sql) A MS Access SQL query which performs pivot transforms on a water meter data.
6. **First person shooter movement (C#, Unity):** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/CSharp-Unity-Scripts/tree/master/FPS) Part of the virtual reality(VR) project, it contains the scripts that program the movement of a first person shooter in the game engine, including object pick up, player look and move around.
