### Data Science
* * *
List of Data Science, AI, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, NLP projects that I tackled using Python/R/MATLAB. 

  1. **[Kaggle] Recruit Restaurant Forecasting Vistor:**  [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Useful-Python-Scripts/tree/master/Kaggle/Recruit%20Restaurant%20Visitor%20Forecasting) I was given 3-5 days to work on this case study and the goal is to predict the number of visitors of each restaurants in Japan for future dates. The link contains data analysis and prediction scripts written in Python.
  2. **[Kaggle] BigQuery Geotab Intersection Congestion:** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Useful-Python-Scripts/tree/master/Kaggle/BigQuery%20Geotab%20Intersection%20Congestion) The main objective is to predict wait times at four major city intersections in USA. I explored the data sets using Python and the script can be found in the given link.
  3. **Urban Sound Recognition:** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Useful-Python-Scripts/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/Urban%20Sound%20Recognition) The main objective is to identify the sound events from the urban area using Convolutional Netural Networks (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Scripts include real time sound recognition via computer microphone using CNN model.
  4. **Email Sentiment Analysis:** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/Useful-Python-Scripts/tree/master/NLP/Email%20Sentiment%20Analysis) I use VADER and Spacy to perform Natural Language Processing Sentiment Analysis on my work emails to understand if the message I received or the sender are generally positive, negative or neutral.

### Data Visualisation
* * *
A list of Visualisation dashboards that I created using Power BI or Tableau. 
* **Power BI:**
  1. **Interactive Resume:**  [[LINK]](https://bit.ly/yeevienresume2) My Interactive Resume.

* **Tableau:**

### Mathematical Optimisation
* * *
Mathematical Optimisation projects built mainly in LINGO (an Optimisation modelling software) and Excel. Click on the [LINK] to view it.
* **LINGO:**
  1. **Optimise Depot Location:** [[LINK]](https://github.com/yvien226/LINGO-Optimization/tree/master/Depot%20Location) This is a simple optimisation project with data being generated randomly. The main objective is to identify the optimal depot location for a water utility to service the maintenance jobs and minimize travel times.
