# About me
My name is Yee Vien Ng. I was born in Selangor, Malaysia but I have been living and working in Melbourne, Australia for the past 9 years.

I graduated at RMIT University with Bachelor of Mathematics, and I am presently a Modelling Analyst. During my career, I assisted  clients to develop advanced analytical models to help investigate and deliver improvements of the business. 

Some of the tools that I used include:
- **MATLAB:** For Data Analysis, Machine Learning and building Mathematical models
- **Python:** For General programming, Data Analysis, Machine Learning and building Mathematical models
- **SQL:** For Data cleaning, data management, data storage and retrieval
- **Power BI:** For Data Visualization
- **Tableau (Basic):** For Data Visualization
- **Excel, VBA:** For Data Analysis and building interactive models
- **Simulink:** For Data Simulation

I have always been interested in Mathematics, Programming and Technology. I love using data to tell compelling stories and to solve various problems. I also enjoy coding and learning new programming languages in my spare time. Outside of my work and programming, I love to go out for a run and swim.

If you would like to know more about me or just like to chat, feel free to [contact me](./contact.html). :)
