# About Me
My name is Yee Vien Ng. I was born in Selangor, Malaysia but I have been living and working in Melbourne, Australia since 2009.

I graduated at RMIT University with Bachelor of Mathematics, and I am presently a Modelling Analyst. During my career, I assisted clients to develop advanced analytical models, Optimisation or apply Machine Learning techniques to help investigate and deliver improvements of the business. 

Some of the tools that I used include:
- **MATLAB:** For Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Mathematical Optimisation
- **Python:** For General programming, Data Analysis, Data Science and Machine Learning
- **SQL:** For Data Cleaning, Data Management, Data Storage and Retrieval
- **Power BI:** For Data Visualisation
- **Tableau (Basic):** For Data Visualisation
- **Excel, VBA:** For Data Analysis and building interactive models
- **Simulink:** For Data Simulation
- **LINGO:** For Mathematical Optimisation

I have always been interested in Data Science, AI and Machine Learning. I love building things and I like to use data to tell compelling stories and to solve various problems. I also enjoy coding and learning new programming languages in my spare time. Outside of my work and programming, I love to go out for a run and swim.

If you would like to know more about me or just like to chat, feel free to [contact me](./contact.html). :)
